,,"Dear Client,In the query, you express your current situation post-sabbatical leave, but did not share the nature of legal remedies that suit you most in the given situation. However, be informed that Sabbatical leave is granted by employers to help employees take extended breaks from their routine work. This leave allows employees to pursue professional courses to enhance their skills or address personal needs. A sabbatical leave can range from three months to a year. The duration of a sabbatical leave is usually decided by the employer, and it can vary depending on the company's policies and the employee's role. Sabbatical leave may be paid, partially paid, or unpaid, depending on the employer's policy and the specific circumstances. You can even resign while on sabbatical unless your contract stipulates otherwise. While your sabbatical leave ends on 15th April, you tender your resignation on 15th May, which puts you to face a loss of one month's pay. So, if the offer of the Company for the settlement of F & F dues post resignation appears to you unreasonable or unjustified, you may escalate your grievance before the HR Head of the Company, failing which, serving a legal notice to the Company, you can make a complaint to the concerned Labour Commissioner or the Chief Inspector, Shops and Establishment seeking their intervention to resolve the grievance, provided you are a workman as defined under Section 2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.

,,"Dear Client,A service/employment bond itself does not create any relationship between an employer and an employee unless and until it is followed by the essential steps required to make the Bond valid and enforceable under the law. The validity of Employment bonds can be challenged based on Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, which prohibits any agreement in restraint of trade and profession. The law states that an agreement (employment bond) will be illegal only if it restrains someone from exercising a lawful profession/ trade/ business. As per the mandate of Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, any terms and conditions of an agreement that directly or indirectly compel the employee to serve the employer or put a restriction on them joining the competitor or other employer are not valid. Under the Indian Contract Act, an employment bond is considered void under the following circumstances: (1) Agreements in which consideration and objects are unlawful in part (Section 24); (2) Agreements without consideration unless it is in writing and registered, or is a promise to compensate for something done (Section 25); (3) Agreements in restraint of marriage (Section 26); (4) Agreement in restraint of trade or profession(Section 27). However, apart from the legal validity and enforceability of a service bond, your situation is admittedly different to some extent. Once a person, after accepting an offer/appointment letter, resumes his assigned job, and leaves without notice, is considered to have committed misconduct and attracts disciplinary action following the service rules or standing orders of the establishment. The company has the right to take disciplinary action if the employee absents themselves from the workplace without notice or serving a notice period following the terms of employment, which may result in termination for proven misconduct. Even for breach of the terms of the contract employer can file a civil suit against the absconded employee for damages in case such unauthorised absence incurs financial loss to the employer. So, in the given scenario, serving a legal notice to the absconded employees, you may initiate disciplinary action against them following the principle of natural justice to terminate them for proven misconduct, and can also file a civil suit against them claiming damages.

I am stuck in my head if i should file a case against them or not( Indore, Madhya Pradesh )","Dear Client,It's illegal for employers to discriminate against a woman employee based on her employment status or pregnancy status. An employer cannot discriminate against a woman employee based on her pregnancy status during her pregnancy or post-pregnancy, affecting her maternity rights. Section 12 of the Act explicitly prohibits employers from dismissing or terminating a woman’s employment on account of her pregnancy or absence due to maternity leave. The Maternity Benefit Act 1961 states that a woman employee can apply for Maternity leave regardless of her nature or category of employment, i.e, probation, intern, casual, contractual, or permanent if she has worked with the employer for 80 days in the last 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery. The duration of maternity leave for both first and second-time mothers is 6 months or 26 weeks. This leave can be availed either before or within 6 months from the date of delivery of the child. Once a woman employee applies for maternity leave, the Company is duty-bound to approve her leave and disburse to her all the monetary benefits available under the Act. Once you are eligible for maternity leave, you are entitled to avail of 26 weeks of maternity leave with full pay and return to your job, and the employer can not fire you from employment because of absence from work owing to pregnancy. Employers cannot even alter the terms of employment or service conditions to a woman’s disadvantage because she availed of maternity leave. However, in cases of proven gross misconduct, employers may deny maternity benefits, but the denial must be communicated in writing to the woman employee. Section 27 of the Act ensures that maternity rights are protected during this period, preventing misuse of contract expiry as a reason to deny maternity benefits. Employers who unlawfully terminate or deny maternity benefits to women employees may face severe penalties under Sections 21 and 22 of the Act, including fines up to Rs 5000 and imprisonment up to 5 years or both, once and aggrieved employee bring the matter to the notice of the competent authority i.e, the concerned office of the Labour Commissioner/ Inspector, Shops & Establishment, State Health & Family Welfare Deptt concerned by filing a complaint against the employer for arbitrary and illegal action affecting your maternity rights that amounted to unfair labour practice. Apart from the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, termination or dismissal other than a disciplinary action for proven misconduct amounts to illegal termination/ retrenchment and is defined as an industrial dispute under Section 2A of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 which also violated the mandatory provision of Sec.25F and 25N of the I D Act that prescribed certain conditions to comply with by the employer before termination/retrenchment of a workman/employee from the employment. Any Termination of a workman is covered under the Industrial Disputes Act, and it falls under ‘Retrenchment’. In the case of Punjab Land Development Corporation Vs Labour Court, 1990 (II) LLJ, 70 SC, the Supreme Court held that The expression ‘retrenchment’ is not to be understood in its narrow, natural and contextual meaning, but is to be understood in its wider, literal meaning to mean termination of service of a workman for any reason whatsoever. Further, in the case of Santosh Gupta Vs State Bank of Patiala AIR 1980 SC 1219, the Supreme Court ruled that the expression retrenchment must include every termination of the services of a workman by an act of the employer. In that scenario, the terminated employee/workman serving a legal notice to the employer can raise an industrial dispute before the concerned Labour Commissioner for redressal of the complaint failing which he/she can approach directly the Industrial Tribunal/Labor Court concerned for adjudication provided he/she is not holding the position of Manager/Supervisor but a workman as defined u/s.2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act. Otherwise, in case he/she is holding the position of Manager/Administrative Officer in the Company, he/she has to file a civil suit before the Civil Court seeking appropriate relief in the matter. If required, you may seek professional advice from an Advocate experienced in service matters to navigate the matter correctly and legally.","Woman employee | pregnancy status | Maternity benifit act 1961 | Section 12 | Section 27 | Section 21 and 22 | Labour Commissioner | Industrial Disputes Act | Section 2A of the ID Act | Supreme Court | Case: Punjab Land Development Corporation Vs Labour Court, 1990 (II) LLJ, 70 SC | Case: Santosh Gupta Vs State Bank of Patiala AIR 1980 SC 1219 | Industrial Tribunal / Labour Court | Civil Court",Illegal for employers to discriminate against a woman | cannot dismiss or terminate employment | cannot alter service conditions to a woman’s disadvantage | eligible for 26 weeks maternity leave | before or within 6 months from delivery | duty-bound to approve maternity leave | fines up to ₹5000 | imprisonment up to 5 years | illegal termination/retrenchment | filing civil suit in Civil Court | Legal advice from advocate,"{'pregnancy status', 'section 22', 'section 2(s)', 'industrial dispute', 'section 2a', 'sec.25f', 'maternity benefit act 1961', 'maternity leave', 'full pay', 'gross misconduct', 'unfair labour practice', 'sec.25n', 'maternity rights', 'retrenchment', 'disciplinary action', 'section 27', 'industrial dispute act, 1947', 'labour practice', 'section 21', 'section 12', 'illegal termination'}

As per the mandate of Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, any terms and conditions of an agreement that directly or indirectly compel the employee to serve the employer or put a restriction on them joining the competitor or other employer are not valid. In the case where the employer can prove that the employee is joining the competitor to disclose the trade secret, then the court may issue an injunction order restricting the employee from joining the competitor. Further, Section 73 of the Act makes provision for unliquidated damages (not stipulated in a contract), Section 74 deals with liquidated damages (stipulated in a contract), and no compensation is attracted for mere breach of contract u/s.73 and Section 74 of the Act unless such breach resulted in an actual loss or damage to the opposite party employer.

Typically, a Letter of Intent isn't fully binding, but specific clauses within it, such as those related to a bond or financial penalties for not joining, can be enforceable.Employment bonds are common, aiming to recover costs if you don't join or leave prematurely, but their enforceability often hinges on being ""reasonable"" and not an unreasonable restraint of trade under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act.
