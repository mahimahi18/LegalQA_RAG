,,"Dear Client,In the query, you express your current situation post-sabbatical leave, but did not share the nature of legal remedies that suit you most in the given situation. However, be informed that Sabbatical leave is granted by employers to help employees take extended breaks from their routine work. This leave allows employees to pursue professional courses to enhance their skills or address personal needs. A sabbatical leave can range from three months to a year. The duration of a sabbatical leave is usually decided by the employer, and it can vary depending on the company's policies and the employee's role. Sabbatical leave may be paid, partially paid, or unpaid, depending on the employer's policy and the specific circumstances. You can even resign while on sabbatical unless your contract stipulates otherwise. While your sabbatical leave ends on 15th April, you tender your resignation on 15th May, which puts you to face a loss of one month's pay. So, if the offer of the Company for the settlement of F & F dues post resignation appears to you unreasonable or unjustified, you may escalate your grievance before the HR Head of the Company, failing which, serving a legal notice to the Company, you can make a complaint to the concerned Labour Commissioner or the Chief Inspector, Shops and Establishment seeking their intervention to resolve the grievance, provided you are a workman as defined under Section 2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.

,,"Dear Client,A service/employment bond itself does not create any relationship between an employer and an employee unless and until it is followed by the essential steps required to make the Bond valid and enforceable under the law. The validity of Employment bonds can be challenged based on Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, which prohibits any agreement in restraint of trade and profession. The law states that an agreement (employment bond) will be illegal only if it restrains someone from exercising a lawful profession/ trade/ business. As per the mandate of Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, any terms and conditions of an agreement that directly or indirectly compel the employee to serve the employer or put a restriction on them joining the competitor or other employer are not valid. Under the Indian Contract Act, an employment bond is considered void under the following circumstances: (1) Agreements in which consideration and objects are unlawful in part (Section 24); (2) Agreements without consideration unless it is in writing and registered, or is a promise to compensate for something done (Section 25); (3) Agreements in restraint of marriage (Section 26); (4) Agreement in restraint of trade or profession(Section 27). However, apart from the legal validity and enforceability of a service bond, your situation is admittedly different to some extent. Once a person, after accepting an offer/appointment letter, resumes his assigned job, and leaves without notice, is considered to have committed misconduct and attracts disciplinary action following the service rules or standing orders of the establishment. The company has the right to take disciplinary action if the employee absents themselves from the workplace without notice or serving a notice period following the terms of employment, which may result in termination for proven misconduct. Even for breach of the terms of the contract employer can file a civil suit against the absconded employee for damages in case such unauthorised absence incurs financial loss to the employer. So, in the given scenario, serving a legal notice to the absconded employees, you may initiate disciplinary action against them following the principle of natural justice to terminate them for proven misconduct, and can also file a civil suit against them claiming damages.

,,"Dear client,To address employees absconding in breach of a 2-year bond agreement, first, thoroughly review your signed agreements and meticulously document all quantifiable losses incurred, such as training and recruitment costs, as these are crucial for proving damages. Before sending a legal notice, ensure you've followed your internal HR procedures for unauthorized absence. Then, engage a lawyer to draft a formal legal notice clearly referencing the breached bond, detailing the financial losses, demanding payment within a specified timeframe, and stating your intent to pursue legal action (a civil suit for recovery of damages) if they fail to comply.While bond agreements are generally enforceable in India if reasonable and tied to demonstrable losses, prepare for a potentially lengthy civil recovery process if the employees do not settle after receiving the notice.",2-year bond agreement | signed agreements ,review your signed agreements | document all quantifiable losses | followed internal HR procedures | draft a formal legal notice | prepare for lengthy civil recovery process,,,,,,

They didn’t give me any notice or prior information about it. I asked them to provide me atleast maternity benifit or to give me one day to think but they denied and hence they terminated me. I am stuck in my head if i should file a case against them or not( Indore, Madhya Pradesh )","Dear Client,It's illegal for employers to discriminate against a woman employee based on her employment status or pregnancy status. An employer cannot discriminate against a woman employee based on her pregnancy status during her pregnancy or post-pregnancy, affecting her maternity rights. Section 12 of the Act explicitly prohibits employers from dismissing or terminating a woman’s employment on account of her pregnancy or absence due to maternity leave. The Maternity Benefit Act 1961 states that a woman employee can apply for Maternity leave regardless of her nature or category of employment, i.e, probation, intern, casual, contractual, or permanent if she has worked with the employer for 80 days in the last 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery. The duration of maternity leave for both first and second-time mothers is 6 months or 26 weeks. This leave can be availed either before or within 6 months from the date of delivery of the child. Once a woman employee applies for maternity leave, the Company is duty-bound to approve her leave and disburse to her all the monetary benefits available under the Act. Once you are eligible for maternity leave, you are entitled to avail of 26 weeks of maternity leave with full pay and return to your job, and the employer can not fire you from employment because of absence from work owing to pregnancy. Employers cannot even alter the terms of employment or service conditions to a woman’s disadvantage because she availed of maternity leave. However, in cases of proven gross misconduct, employers may deny maternity benefits, but the denial must be communicated in writing to the woman employee. Section 27 of the Act ensures that maternity rights are protected during this period, preventing misuse of contract expiry as a reason to deny maternity benefits. Employers who unlawfully terminate or deny maternity benefits to women employees may face severe penalties under Sections 21 and 22 of the Act, including fines up to Rs 5000 and imprisonment up to 5 years or both, once and aggrieved employee bring the matter to the notice of the competent authority i.e, the concerned office of the Labour Commissioner/ Inspector, Shops & Establishment, State Health & Family Welfare Deptt concerned by filing a complaint against the employer for arbitrary and illegal action affecting your maternity rights that amounted to unfair labour practice. Apart from the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, termination or dismissal other than a disciplinary action for proven misconduct amounts to illegal termination/ retrenchment and is defined as an industrial dispute under Section 2A of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 which also violated the mandatory provision of Sec.25F and 25N of the I D Act that prescribed certain conditions to comply with by the employer before termination/retrenchment of a workman/employee from the employment. Any Termination of a workman is covered under the Industrial Disputes Act, and it falls under ‘Retrenchment’. In the case of Punjab Land Development Corporation Vs Labour Court, 1990 (II) LLJ, 70 SC, the Supreme Court held that The expression ‘retrenchment’ is not to be understood in its narrow, natural and contextual meaning, but is to be understood in its wider, literal meaning to mean termination of service of a workman for any reason whatsoever. Further, in the case of Santosh Gupta Vs State Bank of Patiala AIR 1980 SC 1219, the Supreme Court ruled that the expression retrenchment must include every termination of the services of a workman by an act of the employer. In that scenario, the terminated employee/workman serving a legal notice to the employer can raise an industrial dispute before the concerned Labour Commissioner for redressal of the complaint failing which he/she can approach directly the Industrial Tribunal/Labor Court concerned for adjudication provided he/she is not holding the position of Manager/Supervisor but a workman as defined u/s.2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act. Otherwise, in case he/she is holding the position of Manager/Administrative Officer in the Company, he/she has to file a civil suit before the Civil Court seeking appropriate relief in the matter.

,,"Dear Client,In the relationship between an employer and employee that is governed by an appointment letter or offer letter, followed by a service bond in some cases, documents like a post-dated cheque or a letter of intent do not take place, which may be considered unfair labour practice on contest. However, the actions of the management can be challenged based on Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, which prohibits any agreement in restraint of trade and profession. As per the mandate of Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act,1872, any terms and conditions of an agreement that directly or indirectly compel the employee to serve the employer or put a restriction on them joining the competitor or other employer are not valid. In the case where the employer can prove that the employee is joining the competitor to disclose the trade secret, then the court may issue an injunction order restricting the employee from joining the competitor. Further, Section 73 of the Act makes provision for unliquidated damages (not stipulated in a contract), Section 74 deals with liquidated damages (stipulated in a contract), and no compensation is attracted for mere breach of contract u/s.73 and Section 74 of the Act unless such breach resulted in an actual loss or damage to the opposite party employer. So, in the prevailing situation, if you are not holding a position of manager or supervisor in the Company, but a workman as defined under Sec.2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. serving a legal notice to the Company, reach out to the office of the concerned Labour Commissioner or the office of the Chief Inspector, Shops and Establishments, as the case may be, to file a complaint against the company over alleged unfair labour practice for redressal of your grievance.

Typically, a Letter of Intent isn't fully binding, but specific clauses within it, such as those related to a bond or financial penalties for not joining, can be enforceable.Employment bonds are common, aiming to recover costs if you don't join or leave prematurely, but their enforceability often hinges on being ""reasonable"" and not an unreasonable restraint of trade under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act. This means the company generally needs to prove actual losses incurred, not just claim an arbitrary sum.

The state-specific Shops and Establishments Act applies to shop and establishment employees who are not covered under the ID Act, such as those in managerial or administrative positions, and varies from state to state.

So, So, in the absence of a notice under Section 9A of the I D Act or specific stipulation in the appointment letter or subsequent revision of the terms of employment, the extension of the notice period is considered unfair labour practices as defined under Section 2(ra) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.

11 (Expansion),"Subject- Urgent Help Needed â€“ Apartment Maintenance Issues 
 
 I am writing to seek guidance regarding serious maintenance and financial issues in our apartment complex. 
 
 Our residential building consists of 22 flats located in Kukatpally, Hyderabad. Each flat is required to contribute â‚¹900 per month** for maintenance expenses, which cover essential services such as cleaning, security, electricity for common areas, and minor repairs. However, for the past two years, about 5-6 flat owners have not been paying their maintenance fees. This has created a financial crisis, making it extremely difficult to manage necessary upkeep. 
 
 Currently, our balance sheet shows a deficit of - â‚¹60,000 to -â‚¹90,000, meaning we are operating at a loss. Despite multiple reminders through phone calls, messages, and personal visits, these owners continue to ignore our requests. The situation is further complicated because most of these owners do not reside in the building, making communication even more challenging. 
 
 Additionally, one flat remains unoccupied, but the owner refuses to pay any maintenance charges, which adds to the financial burden on responsible residents. 
 
 Our building is 25 years old, and no major repairs have been carried out, including: 
 - Drainage pipes â€“ They have not been repaired or replaced in over two decades, leading to leaks and blockages. 
 - Exterior painting â€“ The building has never been repainted, making it look deteriorated and unmaintained. 
 
 To address these urgent repairs, we proposed that each flat contribute â‚¹13,000 for these improvements. However, only 10 flats have agreed to pay, while the remaining owners remain unresponsive. This lack of cooperation is preventing us from ensuring the safety, cleanliness, and longevity of our apartment complex. 
 
 We would appreciate your legal advice on the following concerns: 
 1. How can we ensure that all flat owners pay their maintenance fees on time? 
 2. Can legal action be taken against those who refuse to contribute? If so, what steps should we follow? 
 3. Are there any laws in Hyderabad or Telangana that mandate apartment owners to participate in maintenance costs?
 4. How can we prevent such issues in the future to ensure better cooperation among residents? 
 
 Your expert guidance will help us protect our apartment and create a fair system where every owner shares responsibility. 
 
 Looking forward to your advice. 
 Thank you.( Hyderabad, Telangana )","Dear client,Based on your situation, it's clear that your apartment complex is facing serious challenges due to non-payment of maintenance dues and a lack of cooperation from certain flat owners. Legally, under the Telangana Apartments (Promotion of Construction and Ownership) Act, 1987, all flat owners are obligated to contribute towards maintenance and common area expenses. If your Apartment Ownersâ€™ Association is registered under this Act, it has the legal authority to enforce the collection of maintenance charges and special repair contributions. You should first issue formal legal notices to the defaulting owners by registered post, demanding payment within a stipulated period. If they still fail to pay, the Association can initiate civil recovery proceedings before the local Civil Court or Small Causes Court, depending on the amount. You may also impose late payment penalties or interest as per your Associationâ€™s by-laws. While you cannot disconnect essential services like water or electricity, you can restrict access to non-essential amenities such as parking or recreation areas. In cases where an Association is not yet registered, you should prioritize its registration, as it provides the legal foundation for collaboration and enforcement of compliance. Furthermore, you can prevent future disputes by updating and strictly enforcing your bylaws, digitizing payments and financial records, holding regular general body meetings to pass resolutions on repairs, and maintaining transparency in all decisions. It is also advisable to create a sinking fund for long-term repairs. Clear communication, formal resolutions, and legal enforcement, when necessary, will help ensure that all flat owners share the financial responsibilities fairly and consistently.","non-payment of maintenance dues | lack of cooperation | Telangana Apartments (Promotion of Construction and Ownership) Act, 1987 | obligated to contribute | maintenance and common area expenses | Apartment Owners’ Association registered | enforce collection of maintenance | special repair contributions | issue formal legal notices | defaulting owners | civil recovery proceedings | Civil Court | Small Causes Court | impose late payment penalties | Association’s by-laws | cannot disconnect essential services | restrict non-essential amenities | Association not yet registered | prioritize its registration | enforcing your bylaws | general body meetings | pass resolutions | sinking fund | long-term repairs",,"Precision: 0.111

,,"Dear Client,These kinds of issues are common and mostly occur in standalone buildings or housing complexes that lack a registered society or association to resolve the matter, as per their bylaws. So, to resolve the issues legally, first, you need to form a society and register it under the state-specific Cooperative Societies Act. For the formation and registration of a Society under the state-specific Act, at least seven members are required. However, till the formation and registration, in the given scenario, you can escalate your grievance before the quasi-judicial authorities like the Public Grievance Cell of the District Magistrate Office, Municipal authorities, Dist. Legal Services Authority seeking their intervention to resolve the matter through a mediation process amicably for the sake of peaceful co-existence in the absence of a registered Society/RWA. Once a society is formed and registered, you can take actions against the defaulters following the provisions of the Byelaws of the Society and even by filing a money recovery suit before the jurisdictional Civil Court, serving a legal notice on behalf of the Society. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Rasila S. Mehta vs. Custodian, Nariman Bhavan, Mumbai, decided on 6 May 2011, held that members of a society are liable to pay such dues as determined by the society towards the maintenance and upkeep of flats and common utilities, irrespective of the nature of occupancy, they must pay the maintenance charges. You may visit the office of the Registrar appointed under the state-specific Cooperative Societies Act or the competent authority appointed under the state-specific Apartment Ownership Act for the formation and registration of the Society or Association(RWA).",lack a registered society | form a society | register it | Cooperative Societies Act | at least seven members required | escalate your grievance | quasi-judicial authorities | Public Grievance Cell | District Magistrate Office | Municipal authorities | Dist.

This law mandates that all apartment owners must contribute toward the upkeep of common areas and essential services. To enforce payments, your association should issue formal written notices and, if necessary, send legal demand notices through a lawyer.If the dues remain unpaid, you can file a civil suit for recovery or approach the Consumer Forum for deficiency of service. To prevent such issues in the future, it is crucial to have a registered apartment association, adopt model bye-laws, and pass binding resolutions during General Body Meetings. Implementing penalties for late payments, restricting access to common facilities for defaulters, and introducing automated payment systems can further improve compliance. Transparent financial records and regular communication will help build trust and cooperation among residents, ensuring fair and sustainable management of the building.","recover maintenance dues | defaulting flat owners | Telangana Apartments (Promotion of Construction and Ownership) Act, 1987 | contribute toward upkeep | common areas | essential services | issue formal written notices | legal demand notices | file a civil suit | Consumer Forum | deficiency of service | registered apartment association | model bye-laws | binding resolutions | General Body Meetings | penalties for late payments | restricting access to common facilities | automated payment systems | Transparent financial records | regular communication",,,,,,,
12 (Expansion),"We are 3 siblings. Our mother is owner of 2 flats in Mumbai. Our mother passed away last year and she had not created a will. On both houses I'm nominated with 100% shares. We 3 siblings had some disputes on the settlement scenario and one of my siblings wasn't ready on doing family settlement agreement previously. They wanted the ownership title cleared for one of our house. So with help of the legal advisor they appointed, we were planning for release deeds however there was again some disputes and we proceeded with joint membership for one flat with 33.33% membership for each of us by submitting all forms with Indemnity bond and my elder siblings name was provided to be added first in Share certificate and the elder sibling submitted membership form as well. Now, we have finally came to alignment on settlement about release deed where my siblings will release their rights on one flat while I will release my rights on another flat. For the house where my siblings are ready to release their rights we have not yet done the procedure for membership with Indemnity bond which was done for other house. I wanted to understand following: 1. If registered release deed is done without first applying for joint membership first, would that be right approach or what is the ideal approach. 2. Since joint membership is not done for 2nd house, can we do the registered family settlement where the clause about my siblings releasing their rights in 2nd house is mentioned, in which case even if joint membership is not done, it would not be problem and society can accept the family settlement to transfer 100% shares to me and add my name to share certificate making me the owner of the flat? 3. Which would be cost efficient and affective, getting joint membership followed by both release deeds OR Registered Family settlement agreement. 4. If my sibling is insisting to keep Share certificate of house where the joint membership was done, is it fine to handover it to them without worrying about any consequences. Can they sell their 66.66% with the Share certificate in their possession? Before handing over share certificate is it ideal and legally permissible for me to submit written letter to society informing them on not processing any transfer, sale or mortgage of any portion or share of flat until they have my written consent or copy of registered release deed or family settlement agreement.( Mumbai suburban, Maharashtra )","Dear Client,Since your mother passed away without a will and you were nominated with 100% shares in both Mumbai flats, the legal ownership still vests equally among all three siblings under the Hindu Succession Act. Now that all of you have reached a mutual agreement, the most efficient and cost-effective approach would be to execute a registered family settlement deed, clearly stating that your siblings will release their rights in one flat and you will release yours in the other.This avoids the need for joint membership applications and multiple release deeds, saving time and legal costs. Societies in Mumbai generally accept such registered family settlements for updating ownership records and share certificates, even if joint membership was not done earlier. Before handing over the original share certificate of the jointly held flat to your sibling,you should submit a written letter to the society stating that no sale, transfer, or mortgage should be processed without your written consent or submission of a registered family settlement or release deed. This step protects your legal interest and ensures no unauthorized transaction occurs, as possession of the share certificate alone does not confer ownership or sale rights.","passed away without a will | nominated with 100% shares | legal ownership vests equally | three siblings | Hindu Succession Act | mutual agreement | registered family settlement deed | release their rights | joint membership applications | multiple release deeds | societies accept family settlements | updating ownership records | original share certificate | written letter to the society | no sale, transfer, or mortgage | without your written consent | protects your legal interest | no unauthorized transaction | possession does not confer ownership",,"Precision: 0.0

,,"Dear Client,When flats are purchased in the joint name, a share certificate is issued by the Society in the joint name, the person whose name does not stand first in the share certificate becomes an 'Associate Member' In case of the death of the person named first in the share certificate, the Associate Member retains the right on his/her flat since his/her name exists in the Sale Deed of the flat as a joint buyer. Thus, in case of the death of any of them, the one surviving joint owner will get an absolute right to the jointly owned flat. The transfer of title or ownership of an immovable property devolves upon a person either through the law of succession post demise of the owner or through a sale deed or deed of gift, paying requisite stamp duty while the owner is alive. The nominee does not automatically become the owner of the assets but holds them in trust until the legal heirs can claim their rights. The nominee's role is essentially administrative, managing the assets until the legal process of succession is completed. Section 30 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 states that, on the death of a member of society, the society shall transfer the share or interest of the deceased member to a person or persons nominated following the rules and by-laws. Section 30(1) of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 provides a mandate to the society for the transfer of the share or interest of the deceased member to a person or persons nominated by the deceased member or, if no person has been nominated to such person holding a Succession Certificate as may appear before the committee to be the heir or legal representative of the deceased member. Provided, such nominee, heir or legal representative, as the case may be, is duly admitted as a member of the society. Rule 25 of the MCS Rules lays down the procedure for the transfer of the shares of the deceased member either in favour of the nominee or in favour of the heir or legal representatives of the deceased owner. In Shakti Yezdani & Another vs Jayanand Jayant Salgaonkar & Others matter, the Supreme Court recently reiterated that nomination is only for convenience and doesn't override the law of succession. Thus, when the successors stake their claim to the property of the deceased, the nominee cannot decline. So, in the case of intestate succession, beneficiaries need to apply before the competent Court, praying for a Succession Certificate to make them eligible to claim a share in the property, and the right to relinquish their share in the property either through a family settlement deed or a release deed comes later. If required, consult with an Advocate experienced in the transfer of ownership of property in the cooperative societies for tailored advice and steps to resolve the issue in the right way.","flats purchased in joint name | share certificate issued in joint name | name not first...

Otherwise, a petition may be rejected at the stage of admission for lack of merit. Hence, it is suggested to consult with an Advocate experienced in service matters for tailored advice to navigate the issue in the right way.","recruitment, transfer, promotion | HR policy | prerogative of the establishment | absence of a vacancy | advised by the doctor | avoid night shift | health issue | management cannot be obliged | place you in the day shift | deviation/discrimination/mala fide | HR policy or rules | Tribunal/Labour Court | High Court | challenging the... policy | petition may be rejected | lack of merit | consult with an Advocate | service matters",,,,,,,
15 (Conflicting),"Transfer fees of 25 thousand rupees to society is payable or not? To the family members such as uncle and nephew giftdeed without any money consideration of SRA flat as per bye law and cooperative society Act.( Mumbai suburban, Maharashtra )","Dear Client,In most cases, a cooperative housing society cannot charge a transfer fee of Rs. 25,000/- rupees for a gift deed of an SRA flat between family members like an uncle and nephew, especially when there's no money involved.According to the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act and its model bye-laws, such transfers within a defined family which often includes close relatives, though ""uncle and nephew"" might require checking your specific bye-laws are usually subject only to nominal administrative charges, typically around Rs. 600 for membership and entrance fees. The Rs. 25,000 cap is generally meant for sales to third parties, not for genuine family gifts. If the society insists on this higher fee, their demand is likely not legally valid, and you have grounds to challenge it with the Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies.","cooperative housing society | cannot charge transfer fee | Rs. 25,000/- rupees | gift deed | SRA flat | between family members | uncle and nephew | no money involved | Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act | model bye-laws | transfers within defined family | nominal administrative charges | Rs. 600 for membership | entrance fees | Rs. 25,000 cap... for sales | demand... not legally valid | challenge it | Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies",,"Precision: 0.125
