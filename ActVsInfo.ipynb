This includes income from all sources such as agriculture, salary, business, etc., for the financial year before you apply for the exam., 3) Your family should not own agricultural land of size 5 acres or more. 4) Your family should not own a residential flat of an area of 1000 square feet or more. 5) Your family should not own a residential plot (in notified municipalities) of an area of 100 square yards or more. 6) Your family should not own a residential plot (other than in notified municipalities) of an area of 200 square yards or more. The land or property owned by the family in different locations should be clubbed while checking the eligibility conditions for EWS category reservations. The definition of Family in EWS reservation means the person who seeks the benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years, as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years. So, given the conditions of eligibility and the definition of family, when your family owns a residential flat of more than an area of 1000 sq. feet, even if it is in the name of your deceased father, you may not be considered for the issue of EWS certificate.\"\"\"\n",

This includes income from all sources such as agriculture, salary, business, etc., for the financial year before you apply for the exam., 3) Your family should not own agricultural land of size 5 acres or more. 4) Your family should not own a residential flat of an area of 1000 square feet or more. 5) Your family should not own a residential plot (in notified municipalities) of an area of 100 square yards or more. 6) Your family should not own a residential plot (other than in notified municipalities) of an area of 200 square yards or more. The land or property owned by the family in different locations should be clubbed while checking the eligibility conditions for EWS category reservations. The definition of Family in EWS reservation means the person who seeks the benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years, as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years. So, given the conditions of eligibility and the definition of family, when your family owns a residential flat of more than an area of 1000 sq. feet, even if it is in the name of your deceased father, you may not be considered for the issue of EWS certificate.\"\"\"\n",

This includes income from all sources such as agriculture, salary, business, etc., for the financial year before you apply for the exam., 3) Your family should not own agricultural land of size 5 acres or more. 4) Your family should not own a residential flat of an area of 1000 square feet or more. 5) Your family should not own a residential plot (in notified municipalities) of an area of 100 square yards or more. 6) Your family should not own a residential plot (other than in notified municipalities) of an area of 200 square yards or more. The land or property owned by the family in different locations should be clubbed while checking the eligibility conditions for EWS category reservations. The definition of Family in EWS reservation means the person who seeks the benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years, as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years. So, given the conditions of eligibility and the definition of family, when your family owns a residential flat of more than an area of 1000 sq. feet, even if it is in the name of your deceased father, you may not be considered for the issue of EWS certificate.\"\"\"\n",
